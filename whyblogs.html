        <h1>Why Blogs?</h1>
        <p>This is a thought that comes very often to people, at least it came to me a lot. Why should I read? Why does someone write? Well, it‚Äôs trivial why you should read and write if you are in school or college, but other than that why should a 25-year-old read or even an undergrad read something that‚Äôs not gonna earn them grades or pleasure üôÇ. I already had an argument against reading, that it‚Äôs boring, and that was a big argument to me at the time.</p>

        <p>Before I give an arguably good answer or an answer at least, well, even I discovered the answer to this less than a year and a half ago when I started to read forcefully, yes forcefully. This happened because I was overly fascinated by the thought of being an avid reader. I was coming across this way too often on my social media feed - Instagram, X (then Twitter), LinkedIn, and even Reddit, which I used rarely, but enough to come across this idea. Although I was never a reader, preferred to watch videos instead of reading articles, watch movies instead of novels, I liked the idea of being a reader.</p>

        <p>I thought and still believe that many people find it a cool personality trait. And as Jay Shetty writes You are not what you think you are, you are what you think people think you are. And since people find it cool (as per my belief), I wanted to build this habit. Another reason was that I had heard and read (surprisingly) that reading leads to knowledge, and I wanted to be knowledgeable. This desire to be knowledgeable also wasn‚Äôt my own, instead because again I liked this trait in some of my friends who could debate (even after a certain point) about history, ideologies, and current affairs. So, both these reasons led to me starting ‚ÄúDogalapan‚Äù.</p>

        <p>Yes, Dogalapan was my first book. I don‚Äôt remember why I chose it, but in hindsight, it looks like an interesting choice to me. Well, I already liked Ashneer Grover back then from his ‚Äúperformance‚Äù in Shark Tank Season 1 and 2, so it was easy to start the book. The first few chapters were all about setting the plot for his ‚Äútriumph‚Äù, and they helped me realize that I like stories. The way the Baniya household tales were narrated had me and made the first quarter smooth to read, and I would get par the daily goal of 15 pages a day (as per my feed) quite easily.</p>

        <p>However, I got bored soon and now started to read in broken stints. 5 pages a day or 10 pages a day went on for some days. And then that was it. I could no longer bear the boringness. Although my feed had told me that consistency is the key and that a habit does not develop overnight, it was overpowered by the boring nature of reading and overshadowed by the interesting hostel activities, and so I quit reading. By the time I quit, I had already reached the so-called most interesting part of the book, the climax, or the anti-climax in this case, I guess the climax of Dogalapan showed Dogalapan. Anyway, it couldn‚Äôt stop me from abolishing the PDF file that remained open on Microsoft Edge (I didn‚Äôt want the guilt of quitting).</p>

        <p>The hostel activities (and the academics üôÇ) got me busy, and the impulsive desire to be cool went dormant or ignored for some days. A month later, another impulsive desire to change my life or make a comeback (as the Instagram reels portray it) hit me. And guess what, I opened Microsoft Edge, which I had been ignoring for the last few weeks. ‚ÄúSmall things make large‚Äù, and so I started reading where I left off - ‚ÄúSir, 116 par khula hai share (The share has listed at 116)‚Äù, I read. I don‚Äôt remember how much I read in a go, but it was a good stint I can recall. I felt good, because I read, and believed that I was doing something productive, although I could nowhere see how it was, but it felt good.</p>

        <p>The desire was strong enough to complete the book, the last 3 chapters of the book, and this time I very proudly closed the tab, and finally I had finished my first book. Can I call myself a reader, ‚ÄúNot yet‚Äù, I said, ‚Äúbut, I can after a few books‚Äù, I replied to myself and went out of my room with a smile on my face, with the very important hostel activities of that day. I wish I had noted down the date.</p>

        <p>Well, excited about my accomplishment, I started looking for my next book to conquer. I consulted Guruji - my wingmate (hostel gives you these names), who possessed this extremely cool trait. He was of no help, however, and I, on my own, landed up on Stay Hungry, Stay Foolish - The Inspiring Stories of 25 IIM Ahmedabad graduates who chose to tread a path of their own making, by Rashmi Bansal. Why this one? Because I had just realized that I liked stories and this one had a lot of them. My summer vacation had started, and I read this one in a jiffy, a couple of weeks I guess. And voila, I had the dopamine kick in. While I was reading this book, I realized that not just any stories, I liked life stories, especially inspiring ones. So halfway through the book, I downloaded my next one - Dream with Your Eyes Open - the autobiography of Ronnie Screwvala. I didn‚Äôt much about the guy, had just heard his name because he was the co-owner of U Mumba, the kabaddi team. It was a life story, and hopefully an inspiring one, so I went on with it.</p>

        <p>This one took some time, but now I was developing a habit slowly, so it felt good. I wasn‚Äôt reading daily, but I was reading and progressing, and yeah it started to feel cool and had now become less boring. I went on and started to develop the habit of reading almost daily with the next books I read. Not that I had become fond of reading or was excited to do it every day, but I did it forcefully sometimes, because consistency is the key and it is indeed I realized gradually.</p>

        <p>Haven‚Äôt completed every book I started. It‚Äôs been more than a year, and I have developed a habit of reading. I might not be an avid reader, but I am a reader now, I like to read. Reading has become more interesting and convenient for me now, more than watching YouTube videos, I like to read entire Wikipedia pages and news articles. I haven‚Äôt read any novels yet, but I am not skeptical about it or argue against it. Yeah, once I watch a movie or a video on some real-life figure, I want to read all the articles on them available on Google.</p>

        <p>By the way, did we forget the question?  Why read? Well, Reading is productive in my opinion. It increases your knowledge base, enriches your vocabulary, improves focus, etc. but above all, for me, it gives you perspectives, it unlocks your ability to think. And when you think, you develop the ability to articulate your thoughts. You might have heard Ben Shapiro or Donald Trump or Andrew Tate, how well they speak, not just that, the content they deliver, Sublime! Starting to read might be your way to reach that stage. It has worked for me at least, not up to that level yet of course, but I can now articulate my thoughts and speak in discussions (debates :)), and judging from people's reactions, it‚Äôs not crap.</p>

        <p>For me, reading is the reason why I have developed a desire to write. I read books, and think about the stuff written, and sometimes I cannot appreciate enough the writing styles of authors. I am often particularly impressed by how well they are able to portray in words what they think and believe. It becomes so impressive sometimes, often characterized by the feeling - ‚ÄúWait, that‚Äôs exactly what I feel sometimes‚Äù or ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs so what happens with me‚Äù, ‚ÄúHow did you put that in words‚Äù, the aha moments, those lines just remain with you for a long time. The articulation just seems oddly satisfying sometimes, appears to me of the level that they have expressed something from their explicit memory. Notice that sometimes an idea is very hard to put in words, but easy to express with a drawing, it gets to that level but with words.</p>

        <p>Some of my the books I read, the Psychology of Money, Ikigai, Zero to One, Never split the difference, were really good read, one either put thoughts into words so gracefully or one forced me to really think about it and in some cases change my perspective on that.</p>

        <p>And that has sparked the desire in me to write. So much that one of the items in my lifetime bucket list is Writing a book, a good book, in the sense that I can build on my thoughts and draw them on paper, and not just me but the readers can see it, feel it. </p>

        <p>And that‚Äôs why, blogs!</p>

<p>Thank You for reading.</p>
