        <p>There are so few people in the world that are going to be successful, so few, you can literally count them, and it wouldn’t even take a day. There are just 2,640 billionaires in the whole world. Such a small number. There were more people probably in your school or college. Not saying that becoming a billionaire is the only measure of success. But think of success, in whatever terms or form you see fit, in an analogous way. Fame? How many people are or have ever been famous. I think whether someone has a Wikipedia page or not is a fair measure to decide if someone’s is famous (enough). There are a little over 1 million people (dead and alive) “registered as famous” on Wikipedia. And how many humans have ever lived? 117 billion.</p>

        <p>What are the odds? 0.000008547. That’s 0.0008547 percent of all the people. You probably didn’t count the zeroes. That’s how it is. But wait a sec. How many people do you think or I think know Gavrilo Princip? How many people do you think know Monti Panesar? Not a history test. But Gavrilo Princip was one of the key people in World War I. Monti Panesar played over 50 test matches for the English National Cricket Team. You know what are the odds of being selected for that. I happen to just know these names because I am interested in History and Cricket, but the thing is we hardly know 2000 or so people on that famous list on Wikipedia. Well, I guess this measure fails. Say someone knows 10,000 names on that list, that makes the ratio, haha, 0.00000008547. I guess fame is even worse than the “billionaires” measure.</p>

        <p>Yes, Success is subjective. But thinking of success as being healthy, wealthy, and wise, is beyond the scope of this blog. But Everyone will accept that the two measures, money and fame, are indeed measures of success, not exhaustive obviously.</p>

        <p>Why did I start writing about this? I was actually thinking what are the odds I make it. A cliche thought, a lot of people have this obviously, but they react to this in some way or the other.</p>

        <p>The Three gunas or modes of life, as per Bhagavad Gita are Tamas, Rajas, and Sattva. How you respond to situations.</p>

        <p>Tamas is Ignorance, ah you just ignore the thought and continue scrolling, a very probable trigger to this thought is social media, the causation need not be immediate but I believe there is a causation relation (mentioning this from personal experience and no credible backing, but just believe that this happens with a lot of people). So, you keep scrolling.</p>

        <p>Rajas is Impulsive. You impulsively react (and not respond) to the stimulus (the urge here). You probably procrastinate, make some plans, get fired up, take a few actions, probably hit some pushups, set a few alarms, sometimes actually follow a routine of some sort for a week, and that’s it. You keep scrolling.</p>

        <p>Sattva is Goodness. You actually take action. You do the scrolling, but you do not “just keep scrolling”.</p>

        <p>Not a blog to fire you up. You may think about the question yourself and respond your way.</p>

        <p>I just wanted to bring the attention to “What are the odds”. I don’t know what it takes to be “successful”. It surely takes something. No doubt, it gives room for failures, it gives time, but hell yeah it takes a lot of efforts. Something that is so improbable to achieve must take something. Not a direct and fair comparison, but think of how difficult are Gaokao and JEE to pass, that have around 0.25% and 1% acceptance rate respectively. And then see where on the number line does 0.0008547(%) lie. It’s insane, and beyond a certain order we do not realise the giganticness of something, like here the number. We know it’s difficult, but we do not and we cannot feel how tough it is. Probably because we have a small imagination range of our emotions.</p>

        <p>We gotta accept, it’s hard. And everyone knows that. But where I think the question gets hidden from the sight of the people, is that we do not look at things zoomed out. We live (or exist, if not live) in the moment, look at things at the moment, and plan in the moment. Instead, the only thing we have to do in the moment, is act in the moment, and act in real not our thoughts. Zooming out is specifically important in my opinion. Words like hindsight and retrospective are two of my favorite words, because I like the positivity of looking at things zoomed out. They get you in a deep state of thoughts, sometimes in serenity, with reduced noise. We generally think this way, with muted noise, due to some stimulus. Like being on the mountains, or watching some inspiring interview, or some pivot points in life, like the demise of someone close.</p>

        <p>People, especially in their 20s (including myself), often doubt themselves and worry about things, in retrospect and in the moment. But zooming out more often clears one’s thought. I am saying this from both personal experience and articles I read, from some great authors.</p>

        <p>The takeaway for me from this blog is the importance of the question, “What are the odds” and the emphasis it puts on the established “fact”, it must take something, we gotta do that.</p>

        <p>Some byproducts I feel can be - Sattva, Zooming out, and acting in the moment and for real.</p>
